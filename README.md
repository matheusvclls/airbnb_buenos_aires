This a a beginner project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree programm. For this project I was interestested in using AirBnB data of Buenos Aires, Argentina, from February 2021 to February 2022 to better understand:

1. What's the most common acomodation per type of room?
2. What's the most frequency neighborhood?
3. How's the interaction between price and type of accomodation?
4. How's the interaction between price and location?
5. What's the best period of the year to travel to Buenos Aires?
